# Joseph_McMahan-Python_Portfolio
This is my end-of-the-quarter portfolio for the BISC 450C Python course. This portfolio contains all of the coding done for the quarter. The codes contained in this portfolio were obtained by following Dr. Vandenbrink as he taught how to code in his youtube videos.
